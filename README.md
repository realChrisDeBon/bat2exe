# bat2exe
A lightweight .bat to .exe converter. This program will convert a batch script file into a portable binary executable.

This is a very simple and lightweight bat to exe converter. The program converts the .bat file into a proper .c class file, then compiles it via gcc.
Batch to exe converter takes first argument as target .bat file, and second argument as the desired .exe output name.
If program is launched without full argument count, user will be prompted manually to fill values.

Feel free to do what you want with this program.
